        "abstract": "A smart city enhances the quality of its citizens\u2019 lives by providing ease of access to ubiquitous services through integration using communication systems at the foundation. Additionally, ITS plays a major role in making a metropolitan area into a smart city. The current IP-based solutions for ITS have slanted the performance due to high demand for data on the move, especially when the consumers become the producers. Meanwhile, NDN has evolved as a promising future Internet architecture and is being investigated extensively. In this article, we discuss the core functionality of NDN followed by our new architecture proposed for ITS in smart cities. Also, we highlight the current and future research challenges for NDN-enabled ITS in the context of smart cities.",

        "abstract": "Different from traditional IP networks, named data networking (NDN) based on the named content can realize fast content retrieval and delivery. As one of the most important architectures for the future Internet, NDN needs flexible, effective, and efficient transport control strategies, which are crucial for widely development of NDN. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey and research challenges on transport control of NDN for the first of time. We first provide an introduction of NDN and its data transport process. Then, the essential differences of NDN transport control compared with IP transport control are analyzed and compared from three perspectives: users side, routers, and network provider. Next, an in-depth taxonomy and classification of NDN recent transport control proposals is given. Finally, we present some research challenges and broader perspectives.",

We use case studies to identify the design requirements and put forth a strawman proposal for the data name design to understand its advantages and limitations.",

However, CVIS is uneasy to meet different QoS requirements of various information flows in the existing traffic environment. In fact, some real-time applications highly related to traffic safety early warning cannot be easily achieved or passengers\u2019 Internet accessing experience is always not very good. To overcome the above problem, this paper proposes a communication protocol named data networking for vehicle infrastructure cooperation (NDNVIC), which can respond to the vehicle\u2019s data query timely. In this paper, we utilize some ZigBee nodes as vehicle and RSU nodes and conduct several simulation experiments under a large-scale deployment with 150 RSU nodes to verify the effectiveness of NDNVIC. Compared with the traditional TCP/IP protocol, the response rate of NDNVIC is about four times, as fast as, that of TCP/IP.",

        "abstract": "Vehicular information network and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies have been receiving a lot of attention in recent years. As one of the most important and promising IoT areas, a vehicular information network aims to implement a myriad of applications related to vehicles, traffic information, drivers, passengers, and pedestrians. However, intervehicular communication (IVC) in a vehicular information network is still based on the TCP/IP protocol stack which is not efficient and scalable. To address the efficiency and scalability issues of the IVC, we leverage the named data networking (NDN) paradigm where the end user only cares about the needed content and pays no attention to the actual location of the content. The NDN model is highly suitable for the IVC scenario with its hierarchical content naming scheme and flexible content retrieval and caching support. We design a novel vehicular information network architecture based on the basic communication principle of NDN. Our proposed architecture aims to improve content naming, addressing, data aggregation, and mobility for IVC in the vehicular information network. In addition, the key parameter settings of the proposed schemes are analyzed in order to help guide their actual deployment.",

        "abstract": "For the last two decades, intelligent transportation systems (ITS) have emerged as an efficient way of improving the performance of transportation systems, enhancing travel security, and providing more choices to travelers. A significant change in ITS in recent years is that much more data are collected from a variety of sources and can be processed into various forms for different stakeholders. The availability of a large amount of data can potentially lead to a revolution in ITS development, changing an ITS from a conventional technology-driven system into a more powerful multifunctional data-driven intelligent transportation  system (D2ITS): a system that is vision, multisource, and learning algorithm driven to optimize its performance. Furthermore,  D2ITS is trending to become a privacy-aware people-centric more intelligent system. In this paper, we provide a survey on the  development of D2ITS, discussing the functionality of its key  components and some deployment issues associated with D2ITS.  Future research directions for the development of D2ITS is also presented.",
